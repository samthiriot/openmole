@h1{Installing OpenMOLE on your computer}

@h2{Try our demo website}
Before downloading OpenMOLE, you might want to get a preview of what you can do with it.
You can try OpenMOLE online using our @a("demo website", href := shared.link.demo).
Please note that the service is reset every 6 hours, so don't be surprised if your current script suddenly vanishes :-)

@h2{Download OpenMOLE}
To run correctly on your own computer, OpenMOLE requires Java version 8 or above.
Check our @a("FAQ", href := Pages.faq.file) to access your java version information.
@br
When Java is installed, you just need to download and extract @a("this archive", href:=Resource.script.openmole.file), and
you're done! OpenMOLE is installed and works out of the box! @br @br
@linkButton(s"Download ${org.openmole.core.buildinfo.version.value}", Resource.script.openmole.file, classIs(btn ++ btn_danger))

@h2{Run OpenMOLE on Linux}
You can then launch OpenMOLE by executing the @i{openmole} file in the installation directory with the @hl.code("./openmole") command.
It will bring up you web browser.
@br
OpenMOLEÂ supports Chrome and Firefox.
If you are using another default web browser, please copy paste the OpenMOLE url (http://localhost:port) in one of these browsers.
